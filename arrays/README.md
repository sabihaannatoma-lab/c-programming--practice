   1. # C Programming Practice - Arrays

Welcome to my C programming repository. This space is dedicated to my learning journey, specifically focusing on **Array** data structures and problem-solving.


## Basic array
* **Input/Output**: Taking user input into arrays and displaying elements.
* **Statistics**: Calculating the average value of array elements.
* **Search Logic**: Finding the maximum and minimum elements within an array.
* **Summation**: Efficiently calculating the total sum of all elements in an array.

##  How to Use
1.  Navigate to the `arrays/` folder.
2.  Open any `.c` file to view the source code.
3.  Compile and run the code using any standard C compiler (like GCC, CodeBlocks, or VS Code).

## Problem solved 
** Second largest number
Finds the second largest value using an array.

*Happy Coding!! Feel free to explore my progress.*
